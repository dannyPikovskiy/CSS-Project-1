<!-- I know that the image on this screen has nothing to do with fishing
    but I think it's funny, especialy when it confuses people into thinking
    that my hobby is a poorly photoshoped image of nonsens. Also, I was 
    going to origionaly make this page about fishing, however, I found that
    image in my camara role and thought that I should use it. It is just gonna
    save me a bunch more time if I don't rename everything. -->
